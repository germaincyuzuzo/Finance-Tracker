Finance Tracker

This is a simple web application that is used to track the users' finances.

How it works:

- The system is a simple one webpage that prompts the user to make a choice whether they want to insert an expense or income. 
- If the users' choice is an expense then it is directly stored in the expenses' database table
- If the users' choice is an income then it is directly stored in the income's database table
- The system by default returns the user's past records that are stored in the database. (It is dispayed on the homepage. For future adjustments, I would work on 
friendly user interface)
